# Development Guidelines

This document outlines the development guidelines for working on the StackOverflow Code Challenges
project located in the `src` folder of this repository. Following these guidelines will help
ensure a smooth development experience, especially when using interactive agents.

## 1. Use the Development Environment

* **Always use `tox`** while iterating on the application. This command runs all necessary
  checks and starts the development environment.
